This\nswell is expected to produce large breaking waves between 6 and\n12 feet, particularly after noon Thursday through Friday.

A High Surf Advisory could be\nissued later tonight or tomorrow.", "instruction": "There is a high risk of rip currents.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties\nand piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.", "response": "Avoid", "parameters": {"AWIPSidentifier": ["CFWSJU"], "WMOidentifier": ["WHCA42 TJSJ 190114"], "NWSheadline": ["HIGH RIP CURRENT RISK NOW IN EFFECT THROUGH LATE FRIDAY NIGHT"], "BLOCKCHANNEL": ["EAS", "NWEM", "CMAS"], "VTEC": ["/O.EXT.TJSJ.RP.S.0008.260219T0114Z-260221T1000Z/"], "eventEndingTime": ["2026-02-21T06:00:00-04:00"]}, "scope": "Public", "code": "IPAWSv1.0", "language": "en-US", "web": "http://www.weather.gov", "eventCode": {"SAME": ["NWS"], "NationalWeatherService": ["RPS"]}}}], "title": "Current watches, warnings, and advisories for Puerto Rico", "updated": "2026-02-19T01:15:06+00:00"}
