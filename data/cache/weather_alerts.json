For the High Rip Current Risk, through late\nWednesday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...For the Coastal Flood Advisory, shallow flooding of\nvulnerable areas will result in a limited threat of property\nand structural damage near the waterfront and shoreline, with\na higher threat near the time of high tide. Isolated road\nclosures are possible. For the High Surf Advisory, high waves\nthat can wash over jetties and sweep people and pets onto\njagged rocks. Rough surf may also knock you down.
