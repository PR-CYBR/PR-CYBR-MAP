For the High Surf\nAdvisory, large breaking waves of 10 to 17 feet tonight, and\nbetween 15 to 20 feet Tuesday. For the High Rip Current Risk,\nlife- threatening rip currents.\n\n* WHERE....Beaches of western to northeastern Puerto Rico,\nCulebra, St. Thomas, and St. John. The most vulnerable areas\nfor high surf and beach erosion include Pinones along road\n187, Parcelas Suarez, Villas del Mar, and Villa Cristiana in\nLoiza; Fortuna in Luquillo; Pueblo and Tamarindo in Aguadilla;\nBarrio Obrero, Pueblo and Jarealito in Arecibo; La Boca in\nBarceloneta; Machuca in Manati; Puerto Nuevo in Vega Baja;\nOcean Park in San Juan; and Barrio Espinal in Aguada.\n\n* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, through 6 AM AST Wednesday\nmorning.

High waves that can wash over jetties and\nsweep people and pets onto jagged rocks. Rough surf may also\nknock you down. Large breaking waves will result in moderate\nto significant beach erosion and considerable erosion of dune\nstructures.

For the High Surf\nAdvisory, large breaking waves of 10 to 17 feet tonight, and\nbetween 15 to 20 feet Tuesday. For the High Rip Current Risk,\nlife- threatening rip currents.\n\n* WHERE....Beaches of western to northeastern Puerto Rico,\nCulebra, St. Thomas, and St. John. The most vulnerable areas\nfor high surf and beach erosion include Pinones along road\n187, Parcelas Suarez, Villas del Mar, and Villa Cristiana in\nLoiza; Fortuna in Luquillo; Pueblo and Tamarindo in Aguadilla;\nBarrio Obrero, Pueblo and Jarealito in Arecibo; La Boca in\nBarceloneta; Machuca in Manati; Puerto Nuevo in Vega Baja;\nOcean Park in San Juan; and Barrio Espinal in Aguada.\n\n* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, through 6 AM AST Wednesday\nmorning. For the Coastal Flood Advisory, through 6 AM AST\nWednesday. For the High Rip Current Risk, through Wednesday\nafternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Rip currents that can sweep even the best swimmers\naway from shore into deeper water where it becomes difficult\nto return to safety. High waves that can wash over jetties and\nsweep people and pets onto jagged rocks. Rough surf may also\nknock you down. Large breaking waves will result in moderate\nto significant beach erosion and considerable erosion of dune\nstructures. Coastal flooding of vulnerable areas will result\nin an elevated threat of property and structural damage near\nthe waterfront and shoreline, with a higher threat near the\ntime of high tide. Lives may be at risk for people who put\nthemselves in harm's way.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A large, long-period northwest to\nnortherly swell will gradually spread across the Atlantic\nwaters and passages through midweek. Seas are expected to\nbuild rapidly up to 12 feet, and occasionally higher from late\nthis afternoon through Tuesday. This swell is forecast to\ncause large breaking wave action along the west to northeast\nbeaches of Puerto Rico, from Rincon to Fajardo, Culebra, and\nthe northern USVI. Swell decay from offshore buoys and model\nadjustment due to underestimation of seas, suggest surf\nheights between 15 and 20 feet during the peak of the event. A\nHigh Surf Warning and a Coastal Flood Warning could be issued\nlater today if buoy observations continue to support this\nsignificant swell event.\n\n* The next high tides are expected as follows: In San Juan, 1.01\nfeet at 9:16 PM AST, and 1.49 feet on Tuesday at 10:29 AM AST;\nin Carolina/Loiza, 0.88 feet at 9:43 PM AST, and 1.36 feet on\nTuesday at 10:33 AM AST; in Arecibo, 1.17 feet at 8:58 PM AST,\nand 1.80 feet on Tuesday at 9:45 AM AST; in Aguadilla, 0.82\nfeet at 8:47 PM AST, and 1.36 feet on Tuesday at 9:32 AM AST;\nin Mayaguez, 0.98 feet at 9:17 PM AST, and 1.35 feet on\nTuesday at 10:01 AM AST; in Botany Bay, St. Thomas, 0.93 feet\nat 9:42 PM AST, and 1.32 feet on Tuesday at 10:16 AM AST.", "instruction": "A High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in\nthe advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and\ndangerous swimming conditions.\n\nA Coastal Flood Advisory indicates that onshore winds and tides\nwill combine to generate flooding of low areas along the shore.\n\nThere is a high risk of rip currents.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties\nand piers.
