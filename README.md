# Puerto Rico Cyber Threat Map

## Introduction
Welcome to the Puerto Rico Cyber Threat Map project! This interactive dashboard is designed to visualize real-time cyber threats and vulnerabilities specifically in Puerto Rico. Inspired by the functionality and design of Kaspersky's Cyber Threat Map and Shodan's Map Explorer, our goal is to blend advanced analytics with a user-centric interface to provide valuable insights into the cyber threat landscape of Puerto Rico.

**Note:** This project is in its early stages of development. Features are being actively developed and will be rolled out as they become ready for public use.

## Key Features (Under Development)
- **Real-time Threat Visualization:** Dynamic mapping of cyber threats targeting Puerto Rico.
- **Detailed Vulnerability Insights:** In-depth analysis and details about identified vulnerabilities.
- **User-Centric Design:** An intuitive and engaging interface for users to interact with and understand the cyber threat data.
